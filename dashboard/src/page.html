        Now that you’ve said hello to the world, it’s time to introduce yourself. Your first blog post is a chance to
        tell readers who you are with a short bio, as well as share what your blog is about and why you are blogging.
        You can include something personal or funny, or add a photo of yourself or your business. Give your readers an
        idea of what to expect in upcoming blog posts.

          Format each of your headings below to Heading 2 to keep your post neat and SEO-friendly.

      </p>
      <p>
        It might help to break up your introduction into 2 or 3 main points, so it’s easy for your readers to follow.
        Each paragraph or two should focus on one point.

      <h2>Check Your Post Settings</h2>
      <p>Explore the sidebar on the left. You can add media to add color to your post. You can also change the cover
        image, optimize the SEO Settings, add categories or tags, and much more. Spend some time discovering each tab
        and learn how you can enhance your future posts.</p>

      <h2>Add a Closing Message</h2>
      <p>
        End by restating your main message. You can sign off with a funny note or an open question.
        Use this space to tell readers what they should do next. Invite readers to leave a comment, or add a button with
        your main call-to-action, e.g., <strong>Buy Now or Subscribe</strong>.
